# About Me

I am a motivated individual who likes learning on my own time. I enjoy tinkering with new technologies to keep my skills up to date. I always take the opportunity to mentor others to share the knowledge I have learned over the years to save them some headaches and grief. The thing I like most about my profession is that I learn something new every day.  I like to develop with technologies such as node.js, javascript, html, css, javascript and frameworks like angular, vue and spring.

I have different code examples and projects on [Github](https://github.com/davidjamesherzog?tab=repositories).
