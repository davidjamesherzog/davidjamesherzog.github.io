        <title>Angular and Bulma</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently wanted to include the Bulma CSS library into my Angular project.  I didn't just want to include the library in my project, I wanted to be able to include just pieces of the library and maybe override a thing or two.  This post will explain how to include Bulma into your Angular projects using SASS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be times in your development process where you might want to run your code locally just like you would run it in production.  Most of us run different operating systems for development than where we run our production code.  Docker makes it easy for you to spin up an enviroment that mimics your production enviroment locally.&lt;/p&gt;
